# Consulting skeleton

Things marked `- [ ]` are things you should make sure to address as project leader.

## Stage 1: Client meeting

Ask the client to describe their project. You can often give them leeway to describe as they see fit, but by the end of the meeting you need to know the answers to two questions: 
- [ ] What question does the client want answered? 
- [ ] How were the data generated?
- [ ] What specifically are you supposed to do?

## Stage 2: Make an analysis plan

Once you understand the client's question and the data-generating process, your job as a statistician is to translate the client's question into a statistical problem.
This should be cleared with the client. Clients vary in how comfortable they are with statistics --- some will just want to trust you, while others will want an explanation. Some clients also come with a specific type of analysis in mind, and your job is then to evaluate whether that model/test/technique is appropriate to the situation.
If you have a very simple project, you can describe the analysis plan in the initial client meeting and ask the client to sign off then.
Otherwise, you should write down the plan after the initial client meeting.
The plan should describe:
- [ ] What model/test/technique you plan to use.
- [ ] A justification for that choice. This should consist of: (a) the probabilistic model you think describes the data, (b) any simplifications of the model you are imposing to do your test/estimate parameters, and (c) justifications of the simplifications.

## Stage 3: Perform the analysis

You will need to 
- [ ] Get the data on your computer.
- [ ] Do quality checks (make sure it looks like what the client said it should).
- [ ] Get the data into the correct format for the function(s) you are going to use to fit the model.
- [ ] Fit the model, get the number(s) you need from the output.
