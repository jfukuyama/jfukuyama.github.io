# Setup

You have:

- Code that is correct

- Code that is slow for the application you want

. . .

You want:

- Code that is correct

- Code that runs in a reasonable amount of time

-----

Two steps:

- Find what the bottleneck is

- Rewrite the code for the bottleneck to make it run faster

What to do?

- Make a smaller example that runs quickly

- Write tests (formal or informal) for the output of the function

- Make a new function to implement the same algorithm, rewritten to be (hopefully) faster

- Check on the test cases that it gives the same output

- Check whether the new version is faster


# Finding what the problem is

Base R function for this task is `Rprof`.

Many other packages, e.g. `profvis` (I believe what RStudio uses now) are based on `Rprof`, usually with more nicely formatted output.

-----

How does Rprof work?

- Once every set amount of time (default .02 seconds), stops the interpreter and checks what function is being called.

- Output is a list of function calls.

- Output is formatted to indicate what takes the most time.

- It will be non-deterministic, depends a bit on what else your computer is doing.

# For example

```{r}
library(profvis)
f = function() {
  pause(0.1)
  g()
  h()
}
g = function() {
  pause(0.1)
  h()
}
h = function() {
  pause(0.1)
}
```

```{r}
source("profiling-example.R")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tmp = tempfile()
Rprof(tmp, interval = 0.01)
f()
Rprof(NULL)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
summaryRprof(tmp)
```

-----

If we don't sample frequently enough, we don't get very useful output:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tmp = tempfile()
Rprof(tmp, interval = 0.15)
f()
Rprof(NULL)
```


```{r, eval = FALSE}
summaryRprof(tmp)
```


-----

Using `profvis`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
profvis(f())
```



# Checking whether code is faster

Several packages for testing alternative implementations

- `microbenchmark` function in `microbenchmark` package runs the same code a large number of times

- `mark` function in the `bench` package does the same thing but with a little more information and some extra plotting facilities.

# Strategies for writing faster code

- Remove extra work

- Vectorise

- Avoid copies

- Rewrite your R code in C/C++/fortran

# Remove extra work

If you know something about the input to a function, you can speed up your code by skipping some of the steps R takes in checking what kind of data is used.

Here we're bypassing the method dispatch for `mean`.

```{r}
library(microbenchmark)
x = runif(1e2)

microbenchmark(
  mean(x),
  mean.default(x)
)
```

------

The `as.data.frame` function performs many checks and is not optimized for performance.

Suppose that we have a list and want to change it to a data frame.

If we're sure it's formatted correctly, we can use the `quickdf` function.

```{r}
quickdf = function(l) {
  class(l) = "data.frame"
  attr(l, "row.names") = 1:length(l[[1]])
  l
}

l = lapply(1:26, function(i) runif(1e3))
names(l) = letters
```

. . .

```{r}
microbenchmark(
  quick_df      = quickdf(l),
  as.data.frame = as.data.frame(l)
)

```

But we need to be sure the input is formatted correctly, because it does no checks:

```{r}
quickdf(list(x = 1, y = 1:2))
```

# Avoid copies

```{r}
random_string = function() {
  paste(sample(letters, 50, replace = TRUE), collapse = "")
}
strings10 = replicate(10, random_string())
strings100 = replicate(100, random_string())

collapse = function(xs) {
  out = ""
  for (x in xs) {
    out = paste0(out, x)
  }
  out
}

microbenchmark(
  loop10  = collapse(strings10),
  loop100 = collapse(strings100),
  vec10   = paste(strings10, collapse = ""),
  vec100  = paste(strings100, collapse = "")
)
```


# Vectorise

- This will sometimes give speed improvements and sometimes will not.

- Speed improvements happen primarily when it leads to calling compiled C code.

. . .

```{r}
x = matrix(rnorm(15), nrow = 3, ncol = 5)
row_means_loop = function(x) {
    row_means = numeric(nrow(x))
    for(i in 1:nrow(x)) {
        row_sum = 0
        for(j in 1:ncol(x)) {
            row_sum = row_sum + x[i,j]
        }
        row_means[i] = row_sum / ncol(x)
    }
    return(row_means)
}
microbenchmark(
    no_vectorization = row_means_loop(x),
    apply = apply(x, 1, mean),
    c_version = rowMeans(x),
    times = 1000)
```

Another example: a problem in probability.

- Urn 1 contains 10 blue marbles and 8 yellow marbles

- Urn 2 contains 6 blue marbles and 6 yellow marbles

- We draw one marble uniformly at random from urn 1, place it in urn 2, and then draw a marble uniformly at random from urn 2.

- What is the probability that the second marble is blue?

-----

First attempt:

```{r}
# perform nreps repetitions of the marble experiment, to estimate
# P(pick blue from Urn 2)
sim1 = function(nreps)  {
    nb1 = 10 #10 blue marbles in Urn1
    n1 = 18 # number of marbles in Urn 1 at 1st pick
    n2 = 13 # number of marbles in Urn 2 at 2nd pick
    count = 0 # number of repetitions in which get blue from Urn 2
    for (i in 1:nreps) {
        nb2 = 6 # 6 bluemarbles orig. in Urn2
        ## pick from Urn 1 and put in Urn 2; is it blue?
        if (runif(1) < nb1/n1) nb2 = nb2 + 1
        ## pick from Urn 2; is it blue?
        if (runif(1) < nb2/n2) count = count + 1
    }
    return(count/nreps) # est. P(pick blue from Urn 2)
}
```

------

Let's try pre-generate all of our random numbers and remove the for loop:

```{r}
sim2 = function(nreps) {
    nb1 = 10
    nb2 = 6
    n1 = 18
    n2 = 13
    ## pre-generate all our random numbers, one row per repetition
    u = matrix(c(runif(2 * nreps)), nrow = nreps, ncol = 2)
    ## define simfun for use in apply(); simulates one repetition
    simfun = function(rw) {
        ## rw ("row") is a pair of random numbers
        ## choose from Urn 1
        if (rw[1] < nb1 / n1) nb2 = nb2 + 1
        ## choose from Urn 2, and return boolean on choosing blue
        return (rw[2] < nb2 / n2)
    }
    z = apply(u, 1, simfun)
    return(mean(z))
}
```

-----

```{r}
microbenchmark(sim1(100), sim2(100))
```

The timings here are different from in Matloff. I believe this is because more recent version of R [byte compile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode) functions that you write, and this was not true for the version of R used in the book.

-----

Take 3:

```{r}
sim3 = function(nreps) {
    nb1 = 10
    nb2 = 6
    n1 = 18
    n2 = 13
    u = matrix(c(runif(2 * nreps)), nrow = nreps, ncol = 2)
    ## set up the condition vector
    cndtn =
        u[,1] <= nb1 / n1 & u[,2] <= (nb2+1) / n2 |
        u[,1] > nb1 / n1 & u[,2] <= nb2 / n2
    return(mean(cndtn))
}

```


```{r}
microbenchmark(sim1(100), sim2(100), sim3(100))
```

# Overall strategies

- If you know something about your input that R has to check for, you can save time by bypassing the checks

- Vectorised functions are sometimes faster, sometimes not

- Matrix operations generally call C and are therefore fast

- Compiled C code is faster than R code
