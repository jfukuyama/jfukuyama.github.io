## Writing and calling functions

Agenda for today:

- Finish up from last time

- We'll write some functions that let us investigate the birthday problem.

## Function from last time

When a function is called, its body is evaluated in an execution environment whose parent is the function's environment.

```{r}
w = 12
f = function(y) {
    d = 8
    h = function() {
        return(d * (w + y))
    }
    cat("h's environment: ", "\n")
    print(environment(h))
    cat("h's parent environment:", "\n")
    print(parent.env(environment(h)))
    output = h()
    return(output)
}
f(1)
environment(f)
```

-----

. . .

Compare with:

```{r}
f = function(y) {
    d = 8
    output = h()
    return(output)
}

h = function() {
    cat("h's environment:", "\n")
    print(environment(h))
    cat("h's parent environment:", "\n")
    print(parent.env(environment(h)))
    return(d * (w + y))
}
f(5)
```


-----

This perhaps seems overly baroque, but the take-home points about environments (and the reason why they are set up the way they are) are:

- Commands called in the body of the function usually have access to values of the variables in that function plus variables at higher levels.

- Variables defined in the body of a function go away after the function exits.

----


## Side effects

A function has a _side effect_ if it does anything other than compute a return value, for instance, if it changes the values of other variables in the environment it is defined in, or adds variables to the environment.

We generally don't want functions to have side effects, because they make code more confusing and more difficult to test.

In R, functions _can_ have side effects, but it is discouraged by both the language itself and by programming norms.


-----

. . .

Remember that functions can see variables defined in the parent environments.

What they can't do is change the values of those variables (except with a special operator).

For example:


```{r}
w = 12
f = function(y) {
   d = 8
   w = w + 1
   y = y - 2
   cat(sprintf("Value of w: %i", w))
   h = function() {
      return(d*(w+y))
   }
   return(h())
}
t = 4
f(t)
w
```

It looks like the value of `w` changed inside the function, but the value in the global environment was not actually changed.

-----

Primary exceptions to the no side effects rule:

- Plotting

- Data export

## The complement of the no side effects rule

- No side effects says in part that functions shouldn't change variables in the global environment (or any other environment).

- Your functions also should not read from environments other than the function's execution environment.

This rule isn't as strong/there are more exceptions, but in general all the variables your function uses should be given as arguments to the function.


## Some rules for writing functions

- "The first rule of functions is that they should be small. The second rule of functions is that _they should be smaller than that_."

- Functions should _do one thing_. Multiple tasks = multiple functions.

- Related functions should have consistent interfaces: if they take the same input, they should have the same arguments in the same order. If they make the same output, they should give output in the same way.

- No side effects.

- No [magic numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)#Unnamed_numerical_constants).

. . .

But, like [Orwell's last rule for effective writing](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=992): break any of these rules rather than write something outright barbarous.

## Example: [The birthday problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem)

Suppose:

- We have a randomly chosen set of $n$ people

- Each person has a birthday

- Birthdays are distributed uniformly, so every day of the year is equally likely to be a given person's birthday

Question: What is the probability that at least two people share a birthday?

. . .

Logic says: "At least two people share a birthday" is the same as "It's not true that all the birthdays are distinct".

Probability says:

- $P(\text{All birthdays are distinct}) = \frac{365}{365} \frac{364}{365} \cdots \frac{365-(n-1)}{365}$

- $P(\text{At least two people share a birthday}) = 1 - P(\text{All birthdays are distinct}) =  \frac{365}{365} \frac{364}{365} \cdots \frac{365-(n-1)}{365}$


-----

We can write a function that computes these probabilities as a function of the number of people:

```{r}
compute_birthday_probability = function(n_people) {
    p_all_distinct = prod(seq(365-(n_people-1), 365)) / (365^n_people)
    p_match = 1 - p_all_distinct
    return(p_match)
}
compute_birthday_probability(1)
compute_birthday_probability(2)
compute_birthday_probability(22)
compute_birthday_probability(23)
```


-----

Suppose we don't know any probability.

We can try simulating to solve the birthday problem.

As we did before, we can simulate birthdays from different numbers of people and check whether any of them share a birthday.

For just one simulation, we can do:

```{r}
n_people = 23
birthdays = sample(1:365, n_people, replace = TRUE)
birthday_table = table(birthdays)
if(max(birthday_table) >= 2) {
    print("At least two people share a birthday")
} else {
    print("No two people share a birthday")
}
```

-----

If we wanted to do lots of simulations to get an estimate of the probability of a match, we _could_ use a for loop:

```{r}
n_sim = 1000
n_people = 23
match_vector = character(n_sim)
for(i in 1:n_sim) {
    birthdays = sample(1:365, n_people, replace = TRUE)
    birthday_table = table(birthdays)
    if(max(birthday_table) >= 2) {
        match_vector[i] = "birthdays match"
    } else {
        match_vector[i] = "all unique"
    }
}
p_match = sum(match_vector == "birthdays match") / length(match_vector)
p_match
```

-----

Since we will want to use this code many times and run it for different values of `n_people`, we can write a function that takes `n_people` as an argument.

```{r}
do_birthdays_match = function(n_people) {
    birthdays = sample(1:365, n_people, replace = TRUE)
    birthday_table = table(birthdays)
    if(max(birthday_table) >= 2) {
        return("birthdays match")
    } else {
        return("all unique")
    }
}
```

-----

Once we have this, we can write a more readable function that estimates the probability of a match.

. . .

```{r}
estimate_birthday_match_probability = function(n_people, n_sim = 1000) {
    match_vector = character(n_sim)
    for(i in 1:n_sim) {
        match_vector[i] = do_birthdays_match(n_people)
    }
    p_match = sum(match_vector == "birthdays match") / length(match_vector)
    return(p_match)
}
estimate_birthday_match_probability(n_people = 1)
estimate_birthday_match_probability(n_people = 23)
estimate_birthday_match_probability(n_people = 365)
```

## A more complicated problem

The initial formulation of the birthday problem assumes that every birthday is equally likely.

We know this isn't true though: more babies are born on weekdays, and they tend not to be born on major holidays.

Finding the solution to the birthday problem with unequal birthday probabilities is a hard problem for the probabilists, but easy for us.

-----

Step 1: Modify simulation function to sample birthdays with unequal probabilities

Remember the old version:

```{r}
do_birthdays_match = function(n_people) {
    birthdays = sample(1:365, n_people, replace = TRUE)
    birthday_table = table(birthdays)
    if(max(birthday_table) >= 2) {
        return("birthdays match")
    } else {
        return("all unique")
    }
}
```

. . .

We can add another argument, giving the probability of each day of the year:

```{r}
do_birthdays_match = function(n_people, birthday_probabilities) {
    birthdays = sample(1:length(birthday_probabilities),
                       size = n_people,
		       prob = birthday_probabilities,
		       replace = TRUE)
    birthday_table = table(birthdays)
    if(max(birthday_table) >= 2) {
        return("birthdays match")
    } else {
        return("all unique")
    }
}
```

```{r}
do_birthdays_match(n_people = 23, birthday_probabilities = c(1, rep(0, 365)))
```

-----

We can add the same argument to our probability estimation function:

```{r}
estimate_birthday_match_probability = function(n_people, birthday_probabilities, n_sim = 1000) {
    match_vector = character(n_sim)
    for(i in 1:n_sim) {
        match_vector[i] = do_birthdays_match(n_people, birthday_probabilities)
    }
    p_match = sum(match_vector == "birthdays match") / length(match_vector)
    return(p_match)
}
uniform_birthday_probs = rep(1 / 365, 365)
weekend_vs_weekday_likelihoods = c(2,2,2,2,2,1,1)
nonuniform_birthday_likelihoods = rep(weekend_vs_weekday_likelihoods, length.out = 365)
nonuniform_birthday_probs = nonuniform_birthday_likelihoods / sum(nonuniform_birthday_likelihoods)
```

. . .

```{r}
estimate_birthday_match_probability(n_people = 23,
    birthday_probabilities = uniform_birthday_probs,
    n_sim = 10000)
estimate_birthday_match_probability(n_people = 23,
    birthday_probabilities = nonuniform_birthday_probs,
    n_sim = 10000)
```

From the end of Chapter 3 of _Clean Code_:

>Master programmers think of systems as stories to be told rather than programs to be written.

>They use the facilities of their chosen programming language to construct a much richer and more expressive language that can be used to tell that story.

>Part of that domain-specific language is the hierarchy of functions that describe all the actions that take place within that system.

>In an artful act of recursion those actions are written to use the very domain-specific language they define to tell their own small part of the story.
