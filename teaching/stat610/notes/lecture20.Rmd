## Problem for today

Goal, as usual: Maximize a likelihood

- Particularly useful problems with "hidden data" or "missing data"

. . .

The idea behind EM:

- There are some likelihoods that would be easy to maximize if we just had a little bit of extra data

- We can guess at what the missing data should be and find the parameters that maximize the likelihood based on our guess.

- We then alternate between guessing at the missing data based on the current parameter estimates and estimating the parameters based on the guesses at the missing data.


## For example: Clustering with normal mixtures

Suppose we have a set of points measured on one variable.

We think that they come from two clusters, and we want to find the centers of those clusters.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
n_samples = 20
c = rbinom(n = n_samples, size = 1, p = .5)
centers = c(-2, 3)
y = rnorm(n_samples) + ifelse(c == 0, centers[1], centers[2])
ggplot(data.frame(y = y), aes(x = y)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=.3) + geom_rug()
```

-----

We can set up the following model for the data:

$$
\begin{align*}
Z_i &=\begin{cases}
1 & \text{w.p. } p\\
0 & \text{w.p. } 1 - p
\end{cases}\\
Y_i \mid Z_i &\sim N(\theta_{Z_i}, 1)
\end{align*}
$$

- $Y_i$, $i = 1,\ldots, n$ are the observed data

- $Z_i$, $i = 1,\ldots, n$ are the cluster assignments, or the "missing" or "unobserved" data.

- The goal is to get maximum likelihood estimates of $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$, the means of the two clusters, and $p$, the probability of each cluster.

- If we observed the $Z_i$'s, this problem would be simple: $\hat \theta_0$ would be the mean of the $Y_i$'s for which $Z_i = 0$, and $\hat \theta_1$ would be the mean of the $Y_i$'s for which $Z_i = 1$.

## Likelihood for the normal mixture example

We will let $\phi_\theta$ be the normal pdf function, 
$$
\phi_\theta(y) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \exp \left(-\frac{(y - \theta)^2}{ 2} \right) 
$$
so that we don't have to rewrite it every time.


Let $y_i$, $i = 1,\ldots, n$ be the observed data. In this model, the observed-data likelihood for one point is:
$$
p \phi_{\theta_1}(y_i) + (1 -p)\phi_{\theta_0}(y_i)
$$

And the overall observed-data log likelihood is
$$
\log g(y \mid \theta) = \sum_{i=1}^n \log \left( p \phi_{\theta_1}(y_i) + (1 -p)\phi_{\theta_0}(y_i) \right)
$$

Note: this problem is not as well-behaved as the ones we have seen before, the log likelihood in general has multiple local maxima.



## EM: The algorithm

Suppose we have observed data $Y$, missing data $Z$, complete data $X = (Y, Z)$, and parameters $\theta$.

$f(X\mid \theta)$ is the complete-data likelihood, $g(Y \mid \theta)$ is the observed-data likelihood.

We would like to maximize $g(Y \mid \theta)$ (or $\log g(Y \mid \theta)$)

- Start with an initial estimate of the parameters $\theta^{(0)}$

- While you haven't converged yet, repeat the following two steps:

- E step: compute
$$
Q(\theta \mid \theta^{(n)}) = E[\log f(X \mid \theta) \mid Y, \theta^{(n)}]
$$

- M step: Let $\theta^{(n+1)}$ be the solution to
$$
\text{maximize}_\theta Q(\theta \mid \theta^{(n)})
$$

## Example: E step in normal mixtures

Our parameters are $\theta$ and $p$, with current estimates $\theta^{(n)}$ and $p^{(n)}$. The complete-data log likelihood is

$$
\log f(Y, Z \mid \theta, p) = \sum_{i=1}^n (1 - z_i) \log(\phi_{\theta_0}(y_i)) + z_i \log(\phi_{\theta_1}(y_i)) + \sum_{i=1}^n [(1 - z_i) \log(1 - p) + z_i \log p]
$$

. . .

In the E step, we compute the expectation of $\log f(y, z, \mid \theta)$, conditional on the observed values of $y$ and the current estimate of $\theta$, $\theta^{(n)}$.

$$
\begin{align*}
E[\log \;&f(Y, Z \mid \theta, p)  \mid Y = y, \theta= \theta^{(n)}, p = p^{(n)}] \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^n \left[(1 - E[z_i \mid Y = y, \theta= \theta^{(n)}])\log(\phi_{\theta^{(n)}_0}(y_i)) + E[z_i \mid  Y = y, \theta= \theta^{(n)}] \log(\phi_{\theta^{(n)}_1}(y_i))\right] +\\
&\quad  \sum_{i=1}^n\left [(1 - E[z_i \mid Y = y, \theta= \theta^{(n)}]) \log(1 - p^{(n)}) + E[z_i \mid Y = y, \theta= \theta^{(n)}]\log p^{(n)}\right]
\end{align*}
$$

. . .

Finally:
$$
E[z_i \mid Y = y, \theta= \theta^{(n)}]  = \frac{p^{(n)}\phi_{\theta^{(n)}_1}(y_i)}{p^{(n)}\phi_{\theta^{(n)}_1}(y_i) + (1 - p^{(n)})\phi_{\theta^{(n)}_0}(y_i)}
$$

-----

Suppose our current estimates are $\theta_0^{(n)} = -1$, $\theta_2^{(n)} = 2$, and $p^{(n)} = .5$

We can compute the quantities from the previous slide for the data we generated:
```{r}
theta0 = -1
theta1 = 2
p = .5
expected_z = p * (dnorm(y, mean = theta1)) /
    (p * (dnorm(y, mean = theta1)) + (1 - p) * dnorm(y, mean = theta0))
round(head(cbind(y, expected_z)), digits = 3)
```


## Example: M step in normal mixtures

You can either go through the analysis, or you can notice that maximizing $E[\log f(Y, Z \mid \theta, p)  \mid Y = y, \theta = \theta^{(n)}, p = p^{(n)}]$ is simply a problem of estimating the mean of a normal distribution with weights on the samples.

If we let $\gamma_i = E[z_i \mid Y = y, \theta= \theta^{(n)}]$, then our new parameters are
$$
\begin{align*}
\theta^{(n+1)}_0 &= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (1 - \gamma_i) y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n (1 - \gamma_i)}\\
\theta^{(n+1)}_1 &= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \gamma_i y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n \gamma_i}\\
p^{(n+1)} &= \sum_{i=1}^n \gamma_i / n
\end{align*}
$$

-----

Let's look at what the M step looks like on our data.

Remember our previous parameter estimates were $\theta_0^{(n)} = -1$, $\theta_2^{(n)} = 2$, and $p^{(n)} = .5$. The true centers are at $-2$ and $3$.

```{r}
(theta1_updated = sum(y * expected_z) / sum(expected_z))
(theta0_updated = sum(y * (1 - expected_z)) / sum(1 - expected_z))
(p_updated = sum(expected_z) / n_samples)
```

## Some notes

- We can prove that EM is an ascent algorithm

- Tends to converge rather slowly

- No guarantee of getting a global maximum of the likelihood (but sometimes this is a good thing...)


When is this useful?

- When it is easy to get distributions over the missing variables given the current parameter estimates.

- When the problem simplifies after introduction of the missing variables.

- These two conditions often hold in latent variable models, which also tend not to be convex.
