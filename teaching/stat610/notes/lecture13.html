<h1>Lecture 13: Version control and git</h1>
<ul class="incremental">
<li><p>Today: Git for local version control</p></li>
<li><p>Next time: Distributed version

<li><p>Reading (if you want more detail): <a

</ul>
</div>
<div id="version-control" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Version control</h1>
<ul class="incremental">
<li><p>Generally, a system that records changes to a set of files over
time.</p></li>
<li><p>Allows for experimentation: if you have a good version of a
project and want to experiment with a change, you can easily go back to
the good version if the experiment fails.</p></li>
<li><p>Most informal type of version control is by making copies of
files with different names: <code>final_project.Rmd</code>,
<code>final_project_old.Rmd</code>,
<code>final_project_nov_29.Rmd</code>, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="git" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Git</h1>
<p>Basic idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stores snapshots of the project at different points in time, these
are <em>commits</em>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You can easily display differences between commits (= states of the
project at different points in time).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You can easily move between commits (= states of the project at
different points in time).</li>
</ul>
<p>Some nice features:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’ve changed some things and don’t like the results, you can go
back to an older version and start over</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Allows multiple people to work on the same project</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Allows for resolving simultaneous changes as easily as possible</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We have a complete history of who changed what and why</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="two-important-concepts" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Two important concepts</h1>
<p><em>Commits</em> and <em>branches</em>:</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li><p>A <em>commit</em> is a snapshot of the project at a certain point
in time.</p></li>
<li><p>A <em>branch</em> is a pointer to a commit.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="getting-started" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Getting started</h1>
<p>Two ways to make a git repository:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start from scratch. Make a project directory (= folder) where you
want to store the files you will track. On the command line, navigate to
the project directory and then type</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>git init</code></pre>
<p>There will now be a <code>.git</code> folder in the project
directory. This is where the history of the project is stored.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clone an existing repository.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2</code></pre>
<p>This will make a directory called <code>ggplot2</code> and copy the
<code>ggplot2</code> repository into it. This means that you have the
current state of the <code>ggplot2</code> project and access to all the
previous versions.</p>
</div>
<div id="staging-and-creating-commits" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Staging and creating commits</h1>
<p>Once you have the repository, you usually want to change things and
record those changes = create a commit.</p>
<p>Our first problem is that you might want to record just a subset of
the changes that you made.</p>
<p>This problem is solved with the “staging area.”</p>
</div>
<div class="slide section level1">

<p>When you make changes to files, Git sees that they are different from
the last version recorded.</p>
<p>Files can be in four states:</p>
<ul>
<li>Untracked: The file was not tracked (not part of the most recent
commit) and is not in the staging area.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Unmodified: The file was part of the most recent commit but hasn’t
been modified since.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Modified: The file was part of the most recent commit and has been
modified.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Staged: The file was modified or added since the most recent commit
and the new version should be part of the next commit.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="lifecycle.png" /></p>
</div>
<div id="checking-the-status-of-your-files"
class="slide section level1">
<h1>Checking the status of your files</h1>
<p>The command <code>git status</code> will describe the state of the
files in your repository.</p>
<p>If nothing has changed since the last commit, the output will look
something like this:</p>
<pre><code>On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with &#39;origin/master&#39;.
nothing to commit, working directory clean</code></pre>
<p>If there were changes, the files will be shown as untracked, modified
but not staged, or staged.</p>
</div>
<div id="tracking-new-files" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Tracking new files</h1>
<p>To start tracking a file that wasn’t part of the last commit, use
<code>git add &lt;filename&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>For example, if you’ve made a new file called
<code>README</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ git add README
$ git status

On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with &#39;origin/master&#39;.
Changes to be committed:
  (use &quot;git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)

    new file:   README</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="staging-modified-files" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Staging modified files</h1>
<p>If we change a file that was tracked in the most recent commit, it
will be marked as modified.</p>
<p>If we then use <code>git add &lt;filename&gt;</code>, the file status
will go from modified to staged.</p>
</div>
<div id="viewing-your-staged-and-unstaged-changes"
class="slide section level1">
<h1>Viewing your staged and unstaged changes</h1>
<ul class="incremental">
<li><p><code>git status</code> tells you about the files that have been
changed since the last commit, and which changes are staged for the next
commit.</p></li>
<li><p><code>git diff</code>, with no extra arguments, tells you about
the differences between the files that are changes since the last commit
but not staged.</p></li>
<li><p><code>git diff --staged</code> tells you about the differences
between the staged changes and the last commit.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="committing-your-changes" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Committing your changes</h1>
<p>The command <code>git commit</code> creates a new commit
corresponding to the staged changes (so the unstaged changes are not
part of the new commit).</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li><p>If you just write <code>git commit</code> with no extra
arguments, a text editor will open, either the default (usually vim) or
one you have set. In the text editor, you are supposed to write a commit
message describing the changes you have just committed.</p></li>
<li><p><code>git commit -m "&lt;commit message&gt;"</code> will bypass
the text editor opening.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="viewing-the-commit-history" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Viewing the commit history</h1>
<p>The command <code>git log</code> shows the commit history.</p>
<p>Some useful flags:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-p</code>: For “patch”, shows the differences between
commits</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><code>--stat</code>: Shows statistics for files modified in each
commit</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><code>--graph</code>: Shows a graph of the branches and merges next
to the commit history</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><code>--relative-date</code>: Shows the date in relative terms
instead of absolute</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="branches" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Branches</h1>
<p>Problem: We have made a lot of commits. If we want to switch between
them, how do we do that?</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>branch</em> is a pointer to one commit. Can think of it as a
name for that commit.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>By default, you start off with a branch called <code>master</code>
or <code>main</code>, but you can make more, and with any names you
want.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There is nothing special about the <code>master</code> branch.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="how-to-make-a-branch" class="slide section level1">
<h1>How to make a branch</h1>
<p>To make a new branch:</p>
<pre><code>git branch &lt;new-branch-name&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This just creates the new branch, if you want to check it out (make
it so HEAD points to the new branch), you need to run</p>
<pre><code>git checkout &lt;new-branch-name&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Now, if you make new commits, <new-branch-name> will point to the new
commits you made.</p>
</div>
<div id="head" class="slide section level1">
<h1>HEAD</h1>
<p>Problem: if you’re making changes (= adding commits), you probably
want a pointer to the most recent commit. We would like branches to move
when we make a new commit. HEAD solves the problem of updating branches
after commits.</p>
<ul>
<li>HEAD is a pointer to a branch.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When you make a new commit, the branch HEAD points to moves to the
new commit.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <code>checkout</code> function allows you to change the branch
HEAD points to.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="slide section level1">

<p>Start with three commits, two branches</p>
<p><img src="head_1.png" /></p>

<div class="slide section level1">

<p>Add a commit:</p>

<div id="the-repository-in-more-detail" class="slide section level1">
<h1>The repository in more detail</h1>
</div>
<div id="how-all-the-data-is-stored" class="slide section level1">
<h1>How all the data is stored</h1>
<p>Three basic types of objects:</p>
<ul>
<li>blobs: contents of a file</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>trees: an object describing the contents of a directory</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>commits: an object describing the state of the repository at a
particular point in time</li>
</ul>
<p>All these objects are stored by their <em>hash</em></p>
</div>
<div id="hashes" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Hashes</h1>
<ul class="incremental">
<li><p>A <em>hash</em> is a tool from computer security for checking
whether data has been tampered with</p></li>
<li><p>Git uses <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1">SHA1</a></p></li>
<li><p>This is a function that takes data of any size and produces a
20-byte hash value.</p></li>
<li><p>This is usually displayed as a 40-digit hexadecimal
number.</p></li>
<li><p>Idea behind a hash function is that small perturbations in the
data lead to large changes in the hash value, and the function is
designed to be difficult to invert (if you’re given a hash value, it’s
hard to create a file that has that value)</p></li>
<li><p>Every object is referred to by its hash value</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="blobs" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Blobs</h1>
<ul class="incremental">
<li><p>Blobs store the contents of a file</p></li>
<li><p>Name is the hash value of the contents of the file</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="trees" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Trees</h1>
<ul>
<li>Blobs just store the contents of the file</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Trees store the file name and the directory structure</li>
</ul>
<p>To see the tree, you can use:</p>
<pre><code>git cat-file -p master^{tree}</code></pre>
<p>And the output might look like this:</p>
<pre><code>100644 blob 01b480b010b7fe66e312e1271dd24e128f3a0290    .gitmodules
100644 blob 1d17afb2a980076fc389f3d2747b0bfefd4df839    Dockerfile
100644 blob 716007c1456163b933cb086acae151fc6a24ca6d    README.md
100644 blob 9af5513cf53dfbdedbc69ec43865dec054de0ccd    SConstruct
040000 tree 100d47915afe22615ff111d390170c7265900b7a    analysis</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="slide section level1">

<p>Conceptually, if we have a directory containing</p>
<ul>
<li><code>README</code>,</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><code>Rakefile</code>,</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A subdirectory called <code>lib</code>,</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A file <code>samplegit.rb</code> in <code>lib</code>,</li>
</ul>
<p>Git would store a snapshot of the directory as three blobs and two
trees:</p>
<p><img src="tree_1.png" /></p>
</div>
<div id="commits" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Commits</h1>
<p>Remember that a <em>commit</em> records the state of the repository
at a particular point in time. It contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hash of the tree object for the top level directory</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Hash of the parent commit</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Meta-information about the commit (author, commit message, date,
etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Commits are also referred to by their hashes, and you should think of
git as storing a set of commits.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide section level1">

<p>Putting everything together, we get a graph that describes the files
that were present at different commits:</p>
<p><img src="commits.png" /></p>
</div>
<div id="overall" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Overall</h1>
<ul class="incremental">
<li><p>A git repository contains a set of commits, which describe a set
of files at a certain point in time</p></li>
<li><p>The main things we want to be able to do are add new commits and
move to different commits</p></li>
<li><p>A branch is just a name for a specific commit, and it allows us
to move between different commits without referring to them by their
name/hash</p></li>
