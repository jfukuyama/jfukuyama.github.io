Today: Metropolis Hastings

Reading:

## Our goals

- Sample from any probability distribution $\pi$.

- Compute expected value of functions of random variables drawn from these distributions, $E_{X \sim \pi}(f(X))$

. . .

- Last time we saw that if a Markov chain has a stationary distribution $\pi$, we can estimate $E_{X \sim \pi}(f(X))$ as $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n f(X_i)$, where $X_1,X_2, \ldots, X_n$ are drawn from the Markov chain.

- Metropolis-Hastings will let us specify a stationary distribution $\pi$ and build a Markov chain having $\pi$ as its stationary distribution.


## Metropolis-Hastings: The Idea

- Start off with a Markov chain that has the wrong stationary distribution, e.g., a random walk

- Modify the chain so that it spends more time in regions of high probability under the target distribution.


## Metropolis-Hastings: Algorithm with a symmetric proposal distribution

Given:

- A proposal distribution $q$ such that $q(y \mid x) = q(x \mid y)$

- A target stationary distribution $\pi$

. . .

Pick a starting value for the chain $X_0$.

For $i = 1, \ldots, n$:

- Pick a proposed move from $Y \sim q(\cdot \mid X_{i-1})$

- Compute the acceptance probability:
$$
a = \text{min} \left \{ \frac{\pi(Y)}{\pi(X_{i-1})}, 1 \right\}
$$

- Let $X_i$ be
$$
X_i = \begin{cases}
Y & \text{w.p. } a \\
X_{i-1} & \text{w.p. }1 - a
\end{cases}
$$

. . .

Note:

- If the proposed state has a higher probability than the current state, we move there deterministically.

- If the proposed state has a lower probability than the current state, we move there with probability proportional to the ratio of the probabilities.

## Aside: Reversible chains and detailed balance

- Last time we talked about conditions for a Markov chain to have an invariant distribution.

- Some Markov chains are "reversible". This is a stronger condition than the chain simply having an invariant distribution.

- To check whether a chain is reversible, we check the "detailed balance" condition: A Markov chain with transition probability matrix $P$ and invariant distribution $\pi$ satisfies the _detailed balance_ equations and is _reversible_ if
$$
\pi_i P_{ij} = \pi_j P_{ji}
$$

## Checking that the Metropolis algorithm has the correct invariant distribution

Let $X_i$ and $X_j$ be any two elements in the state space and let $a_{ij}$ be the acceptance probability given that we start at $X_i$ and propose $X_j$.

Suppose further that $\pi(X_j) \le \pi(X_i)$ so that $a_{ij} \le 1$

We can check that $\pi$ is the invariant distribution by checking detailed balance:

$$
\begin{align*}
\pi(X_i)q(X_j \mid X_i) a_{ij} &= \pi(X_i) q(X_j \mid X_i) \frac{\pi(X_j)}{\pi(X_i)} \\ 
&= q(X_j \mid X_i) \pi(X_j) \\
&= \pi(X_j) q(X_j \mid X_i) a_{ji}
\end{align*}
$$

The last line follows because $a_{ji} = 1$ and the proposal distribution is symmetric.


## Metropolis-Hastings with non-symmetric proposal distribution

Given:

- A proposal distribution $q$, not necessarily such that $q(y \mid x) = q(x \mid y)$

- A target stationary distribution $\pi$

. . .

Pick a starting value for the chain $X_0$.

For $i = 1, \ldots, n$:

- Pick a proposed move from $Y \sim q(\cdot \mid X_{i-1})$

- Compute the acceptance probability:
$$
a = \text{min} \left \{ \frac{\pi(Y)q(X_{i-1} \mid Y)}{\pi(X_{i-1})q(Y \mid X_{i-1})}, 1 \right\}
$$

- Let $X_i$ be
$$
X_i = \begin{cases}
Y & \text{w.p. } a \\
X_{i-1} & \text{w.p. }1 - a
\end{cases}
$$

. . .

Notes:

- The difference in the acceptance probability accounts for the fact that the proposal distribution favors some parts of the space over others.

- You can derive the acceptance probability from the detailed balance equations or check the detailed balance equations with the acceptance probabilities given here.

## Simple Example: Normal Distribution

- Proposal distribution: $q(x \mid y) = N(y, .3)$

- Target distribution: $\pi(x) = N(0,1)$

- Start at $X_0 = -10$

. . .

- Notice that $q$ is symmetric, and so the acceptance probability for moving from $X$ to $Y$ is $\text{min}\{\pi(Y) / \pi(X), 1\}$

```{r}
sample_with_symmetric_proposal =
    function(proposal_function, target_distribution, current_state) {
        proposal = proposal_function(current_state)
        acceptance_probability = min(1, target_distribution(proposal) / target_distribution(current_state))
        if(runif(1) <= acceptance_probability) {
            return(proposal)
        } else {
            return(current_state)
        }   
}
```

-----

```{r}
## The proposal distribution is normal, centered at the current state, standard deviation .3
proposal_function = function(x) rnorm(n = 1, mean = x, sd = .3)
## The target distribution is N(0,1)
target_distribution = dnorm
## check the sampling:
sample_with_symmetric_proposal(proposal_function, target_distribution, -10)
n_samples = 1000
chain_output = numeric(n_samples)
chain_output[1] = -10
for(i in 2:n_samples) {
    chain_output[i] = sample_with_symmetric_proposal(proposal_function, target_distribution, chain_output[i-1])
}
plot(chain_output)
mean(chain_output)
sd(chain_output)
```

-----

Notice:

- We see that before about 200 steps, the chain has not converged to its stationary distribution.

- Even after it has converged, the elements in the chain are not independent.



-----

Let's run the chain longer and discard the first 200 steps as "burn-in"

```{r}
n_samples = 10000
chain_output = numeric(n_samples)
chain_output[1] = -10
for(i in 2:n_samples) {
    chain_output[i] = sample_with_symmetric_proposal(proposal_function, target_distribution, chain_output[i-1])
}
chain_no_burnin = chain_output[201:n_samples]
plot(chain_no_burnin)
mean(chain_no_burnin)
sd(chain_no_burnin)
```

-----

Note:

- This chain looks like it has reached its stationary distribution, and we can confirm that by checking that the sample expected values match what they should be for a $N(0,1)$ distribution.

- The ergodic theorem doesn't require that we discard the burn-in period, but people often do anyway.


## Example 2: Mixture distributions


- Proposal distribution: $q(x \mid y) = N(y, .3)$

- Target distribution: Let $\phi_{\mu, \sigma}(x)$ be the pdf for a $N(\mu, \sigma)$ random variable. Our target distribution is $\pi(x) = .25 \phi_{1, 1}(x) + .75 \phi_{5,.2}(x)$.

- Start at $X_0 = -10$

. . .

```{r}
## The proposal distribution is normal, centered at the current state, standard deviation .3
proposal_function = function(x) rnorm(n = 1, mean = x, sd = .3)
## The target distribution is N(0,1)
target_distribution = function(x) .25 * dnorm(x, mean = 1, sd = 1) + .75 * dnorm(x, mean = 5, sd = .2)
n_samples = 1000
chain_output = numeric(n_samples)
chain_output[1] = -10
for(i in 2:n_samples) {
    chain_output[i] = sample_with_symmetric_proposal(proposal_function, target_distribution, chain_output[i-1])
}
plot(chain_output)
mean(chain_output)
sd(chain_output)
```

. . .

Notice:

- Still takes about 200 steps to get to something that looks like a stationary distribution

- No samples with values above 2!


-----

Let's try running the chain a lot longer:

```{r}
n_samples = 100000
chain_output = numeric(n_samples)
chain_output[1] = -10
for(i in 2:n_samples) {
    chain_output[i] = sample_with_symmetric_proposal(proposal_function, target_distribution, chain_output[i-1])
}
plot(chain_output)
mean(chain_output)
sd(chain_output)
```

What's happening?


-----

Another way to fix this: change the proposal distribution.

```{r}
proposal_function = function(x) rnorm(n = 1, mean = x, sd = 2)
n_samples = 1000
chain_output = numeric(n_samples)
chain_output[1] = -10
for(i in 2:n_samples) {
    chain_output[i] = sample_with_symmetric_proposal(proposal_function, target_distribution, chain_output[i-1])
}
plot(chain_output)
mean(chain_output)
sd(chain_output)
```

-----

Why not always have a really diffuse proposal distribution?

- Tradeoff between exploring the space well and proposing high probability moves.

- With a diffuse proposal distribution, many of the proposals are to low-probability areas, and the chain stays in the same place a lot.

. . .

Plot below shows how far the chain moved on each step when we used the diffuse proposal distribution:

```{r}
plot(diff(chain_output))
```


-----

Overall:

- Choosing the proposal distribution involves balancing between moving long distances and having a high proportion of the moves accepted.

- This will be problem-specific, and you often have to experiment with different proposal distributions.

- There are more formal diagnostics for assessing convergence, but you should really look at the plots of the parameters.

- You can never be sure that your chain isn't completely missing part of the space.

## Summing up

Metropolis Hastings is a simple, general-purpose method for creating a Markov chain with a specified stationary distribution. It is particularly useful when:

- You only know the target distribution up to a constant of proportionality.

- All the regions of high density in the target distribution are connected to each other.

- The target distribution is high dimensional.

. . .

You should be scared because:

- You can never be sure that your chain has explored the space adequately

- There is theory on convergence times, but they tend to say you have to run your chain past the heat death of the universe.
