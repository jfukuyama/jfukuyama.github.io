## Our goals

Next two weeks:

- Methods for sampling from arbitrary probability distributions.

- Main application: sampling from posterior distributions


## Bayesian Statistics

Suppose we have data $y_1,\ldots, y_n$ that we believe can be described by a probability model with parameters $\theta$.

We also have a prior distribution on the parameters $\theta$, describing our belief about the values of those parameters before seeing any of the data.

$$
\begin{align*}
y_i \mid \theta &\sim P(y_i \mid \theta), \quad i = 1,\ldots, n\\
\theta & \sim \pi
\end{align*}
$$

-----

For example:

- Data $y_i$ are heights of men entering the military

- We think that the $y_i$ are distributed $\mathcal N(\theta, \sigma^2)$

- We have some prior belief about $\theta$, maybe that it is around 70".

- We quantify our prior belief about $\theta$ as $\theta \sim \mathcal N(70, 5)$

- Once we have seen the actual heights, we can "update" our belief about $\theta$ by computing the posterior distribution $P(\theta \mid y_1,\ldots, y_n)$

. . .

This posterior distribution is the Bayesian analog of a confidence interval for a normal mean.

## Some more complicated examples

Finance:

- Data are historical stock prices.

- Stock prices assumed to come from a probabilistic model with parameters having to do with the expected return of each stock and the correlations between them.

- Given some prior on the expected returns and correlations, we can compute posterior distributions of the expected returns and correlations.

. . .

Epidemiology

- Data are dates at which people are infected with a virus

- Infection dates come from a probabilistic model of disease spread. Parameters in the model are transmission probabilities due to contact between individuals.

- If we specify prior beliefs about the transmission probabilities, we can compute a posterior distribution on transmission probabilities.



## Posterior distribution

By applying Bayes' rule, we can compute the _posterior distribution_ of the parameters given the data:
$$
\begin{align*}
P(\theta \mid y_1,\ldots, y_n) &= \frac{P(y_1,\ldots, y_n \mid \theta)P(\theta)}{P(y_1,\ldots, y_n)}
\end{align*}
$$

- We want to know as much about this distribution as possible.

- For simple cases it is available in closed form

- For more complicated cases our best hope is to draw samples of it

- From those samples we can compute posterior means, variances, etc. using the Monte Carlo methods from last two classes.

## One way of drawing samples from the posterior

Inputs:

- A target posterior: $P(\theta \mid y_{\text{obs}}) \propto P(y_{\text{obs}} \mid \theta) P(\theta)$

- A way of simulating from $P(y_{\text{obs}} \mid \theta)$

- A prior on the parameters  $P(\theta)$


. . .

Sampling: for $i = 1,\ldots, N$:

- Generate $\theta^{(i)} \sim P(\theta)$

- Generate $y^{(i)} \sim P(y \mid \theta^{(i)})$

- If $y^{(i)} = y_{\text{obs}}$, accept $\theta^{(i)}$

. . .

Why does this work?

- Our draws $(\theta^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$ are samples from the joint distribution $P(\theta, y)$

- Keeping only the values for which $y^{(i)} = y_{\text{obs}}$ is the definition of conditioning on $y_{\text{obs}}$.

## ABC: Simple Example

Bayesian analysis for a Poisson random variable.

Model is:
$$
\begin{align*}
Y_i &\sim \text{Poisson}(\theta), \quad i = 1,\ldots, n \\
\theta &\sim \text{Gamma}(\alpha, \beta)
\end{align*}
$$

By Bayes rule, we can find in closed form that the posterior, $P(\theta \mid Y_1, \ldots, Y_n)$ has a $\text{Gamma}(\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i + \alpha, n + \beta)$ distribution.

Let's pretend we can't do that though, and try using ABC.

Set up the function:

```{r}
generate_abc_sample = function(observed_data,
    prior_distribution,
    data_generating_function) {
    while(TRUE) {
        theta = prior_distribution()
        y = data_generating_function(theta)
        if(all(y == observed_data)) {
            return(theta)
        }
    }
}
```

-----

Analysis for:

- Prior distribution: $\theta \sim \text{Gamma}(1, 1)$

- Likelihood: $y \mid \theta \sim \text{Poisson}(\theta)$

- Observed data: $y = 3$

. . .

```{r}
prior_distribution = function() rgamma(n = 1, shape = 1, rate = 1)
data_generating_function = function(theta) rpois(n = 1, lambda = theta)
observed_data = 3
generate_abc_sample(observed_data, prior_distribution, data_generating_function)
posterior_samples = replicate(n = 1000, generate_abc_sample(observed_data, prior_distribution, data_generating_function))
```

-----

. . .

```{r}
## our posterior should be gamma(y + alpha, 1 + beta) or gamma(4, 2)
## The mean of a gamma distribution is alpha / beta, so should be 2
mean(posterior_samples)
## The variance of a gamma distribution is alpha / beta^2, so should be 1
var(posterior_samples)
qplot(posterior_samples)
theta_vec = seq(0, 6, length.out = 1000)
plot(dgamma(theta_vec, shape = 4, rate = 2) ~ theta_vec, type = 'l', ylab="true posterior density", xlab = "theta")
```


-----

What if you have more than one sample?

. . .

We still have

- Prior distribution: $\theta \sim \text{Gamma}(1, 1)$

- Likelihood: $y_i \mid \theta \sim \text{Poisson}(\theta)$

- Observed data: $y_1 = 3, y_2 = 3$

```{r}
n_samples = 2
data_generating_function = function(theta) rpois(n = n_samples, lambda = theta)
observed_data = rep(3, n_samples)
generate_abc_sample(observed_data, prior_distribution, data_generating_function)
system.time(replicate(n = 1000, generate_abc_sample(observed_data, prior_distribution, data_generating_function)))
```

(Try changing `n_samples` to something bigger on your own computer...)

## Problems

- Only works for discrete data.

- Very low acceptance probabilities, so it can take a very long time.

Therefore:

- Modify the acceptance parameters.

- This makes the method give approximate samples from the posterior instead of exact samples.


## ABC: The algorithm

Inputs:

- A target posterior: $P(\theta \mid y_{\text{obs}}) \propto P(y_{\text{obs}} \mid \theta) P(\theta)$

- A way of simulating from $p(y_{\text{obs}} \mid \theta)$

- A prior on the parameters  $P(\theta)$

- A summary statistic function $s$

- A tolerance $\epsilon$

. . .

Sampling: for $i = 1,\ldots, N$:

- Generate $\theta^{(i)} \sim g(\theta)$

- Generate $y^{(i)} \sim p(y \mid \theta^{(i)})$

- If $\|s(y^{(i)}) - s(y_{\text{obs}})\| < \epsilon$, accept $\theta^{(i)}$

. . .

This method generates approximate samples from the posterior distribution


-----

Set up a function for the approximate version of ABC:

```{r}
generate_abc_sample_2 = function(observed_data,
    summary_statistic,
    prior_distribution,
    data_generating_function,
    epsilon) {
    while(TRUE) {
        theta = prior_distribution()
        y = data_generating_function(theta)
        if(abs(summary_statistic(y) -  summary_statistic(observed_data)) < epsilon) {
            return(theta)
        }
    }
}
```

-----

. . .

Let's see what happens with the approximate version:

We still have

- Prior distribution: $\theta \sim \text{Gamma}(1, 1)$

- Likelihood: $y_i \mid \theta \sim \text{Poisson}(\theta)$

- Observed data: $y_i = 3$, $i = 1,\ldots, 10$

- Summary statistic $s$ is the mean function, so $s(y_1,\ldots, y_n) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n y_i$

- Our tolerance is $\epsilon = .1$

```{r}
n_samples = 10
prior_distribution = function() rgamma(n = 1, shape = 1, rate = 1)
data_generating_function = function(theta) rpois(n = n_samples, lambda = theta)
observed_data = rep(3, n_samples)
summary_statistic = mean
epsilon = .1
generate_abc_sample_2(observed_data, summary_statistic, prior_distribution, data_generating_function, epsilon)
posterior_samples = replicate(n = 1000,
    generate_abc_sample_2(observed_data,
                          summary_statistic,
                          prior_distribution,
                          data_generating_function,
                          epsilon))
```

-----


Checking on the posterior means and variances:

. . .

```{r}
(true_posterior_mean = (1 + sum(observed_data)) / (n_samples + 1))
mean(posterior_samples)
(true_posterior_variance = (1 + sum(observed_data)) / (n_samples + 1)^2)
var(posterior_samples)
```

-----

Checking on the posterior distributions:

```{r}
qplot(posterior_samples) + xlim(c(0, max(theta_vec)))
plot(dgamma(theta_vec, shape = 1 + sum(observed_data), rate = n_samples + 1) ~ x_vec, type = 'l', ylab = "True posterior density", xlab = "theta")
```

## ABC: Some notes

- Difficulties: choice of summary statistics:

    - Theory says they should be sufficient statistics for the model.

    - In practice, they are chosen by expert opinion to be features of the data that are thought to be informative about the underlying parameters.

- Advantage: you need to know hardly anything about the likelihood, you just need to be able to simulate data from it.

- Interpretation of Bayesian inference: parameters with higher posterior probability are simply those that make the observed data match data that we simulate under those parameters.

- Next week we'll talk about more exact methods for sampling from posteriors, but they will require us to know more about the functions
