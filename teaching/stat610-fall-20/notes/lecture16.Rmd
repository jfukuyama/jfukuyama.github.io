## Very short review of probability

We need to know about _random variables_ and their distributions.

------

What is a random variable?

- Very formally: a function from a state space to the real numbers

- Less formally: Think about random variables as describing the outcome of an experiment

-------

. . .

In R, you can draw a random variable from a distribution with functions of the form `rdist`.

- `rnorm` draws a random variable from a normal distribution.

- `rbinom` draws a random variable from a binomial distribution

- `rpois` draws a random variable from a Poisson distribution

... and so on

Syntax is `rdist(n, param1, param2,..., paramn)`

- `n` is the number of random variables to draw from the distribution.

- `param1`, ..., `paramn` are the parameters of the distribution (e.g. mean and standard deviation for the normal, mean for the Poisson, probability of success for the binomial)

-------

. . .

Examples

```{r}
rnorm(n = 10, mean = 5, sd = .1)
rbinom(n = 5, size = 5, prob = .8)
rpois(n = 20, lambda = 10)
```

-------

A random variable is characterized by its _cumulative distribution function_ (CDF).

- Measures the probability that the random variable takes a value at most $x$.

- If $F_X$ is the cumulative distribution function for a random variable $X$, $F_X(x) = P(X \le x)$.

- Can get all the other information you need about the random variable from this function (e.g. probability it lies above a certain value, probability it lies in an interval, probability it lies in other sets)

------

In R, the cumulative distribution functions for common distributions are available as `pdist`, so

- `pnorm` gives the cumulative distribution function for a normal distribution.

- `pbinom` gives the cumulative distribution function for a binomial distribution.

- `ppois` gives the cumulative distribution function for a Poisson distribution.

. . .

Syntax is `pdist(q, param1, ..., paramn)`

- Returns $F_X(q)$, if $F_X$ is the cumulative distribution function for a random variable $X$ following distribution `dist`

- `param1`, ..., `paramn` are the parameters of the distribution

------

. . .

For example:

. . .

```{r}
pnorm(q = 0, mean = 0, sd = 1)
pbinom(q = .1, size = 1, prob = .2)
pbinom(q = 1, size = 1, prob = .2)
```


------

Normal CDF:

```{r}
qvec = seq(-3, 3, length.out = 1000)
Fx = sapply(qvec, pnorm, mean = 0, sd = 1)
plot(Fx ~ qvec, type = 'l')
```

-----

Binomial CDF:

```{r}
qvec = seq(0, 5, length.out = 1001)
Fx = sapply(qvec, pbinom, size = 5, p = .5)
plot(Fx ~ qvec, type = 'l')
```

------

Remember that `rdist` draws random variables from `dist`, and `pdist(q)` computes the probability that a random variable with distribution `dist` takes a value less than or equal to q?

. . .

Let's check:

```{r}
## draw 100 random variables from a normal with mean 0 and sd 1
x = rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 0, sd = 1)
## compute what fraction of the random variables are at most -.5
q = -.5
mean(x <= q)
## compute what fraction of the time the random variables should be less than or equal to -.5
pnorm(q = q, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

Not exactly the same, but pretty close!

-----

. . .

```{r}
## try again with a binomial distribution
x = rbinom(n = 1000, size = 5, prob = .2)
## compute what fraction of the random variables are 1 or less
q = 1
mean(x <= q)
## compute what fraction of the time the random variables should be 1 or less
pbinom(q = q, size = 5, prob = .2)
```

Again, pretty close! You can check for other values of q and other distributions.

------

Final concept: probability mass functions and probability density functions

- Probability mass functions describe _discrete_ radom variables

- Probability density functions describe _continuous_ random variables

------

Discrete random variables:

- The random variable can take on either a finite number of values or a countable number of values

- For example: binomial random variable with size $n$ and probability $p$ can take values $0, 1, 2, \ldots, n$

- For example: A Poisson random variable can take values $0, 1, 2,\ldots$

- If $X$ is a discrete random variable, there are some values $x$ for which $P(X = x) > 0$.


-----

Definition of probability mass function: If $f_X$ is the probability mass function for a random variable $X$, $f_X(x) = P(X = x)$.

. . .

In R: probability mass functions for common distributions are given by functions of the form `ddist`.

Syntax: `ddist(x, param1, ..., paramn)` computes $f_X(x)$ for the a random variable $X$ following distribution `dist` with parameters `param1`, ..., `paramn`

-----

. . .

For example:

```{r}
dbinom(x = 1, size = 1, prob = .5)
dbinom(x = 2, size = 2, prob = .5)
dbinom(x = .5, size = 2, prob = .5)
```

------

```{r}
x_vec = 0:2
fx = sapply(x_vec, dbinom, size = 2, prob = .5)
plot(fx ~ x_vec, type = 'h', ylim = c(0, .5))
```

------

```{r}
x_vec = 0:5
fx = sapply(x_vec, dbinom, size = 5, prob = .8)
plot(fx ~ x_vec, type = 'h', ylim = c(0, .5))
```


------

. . .

As before, we can check that our definitions are consistent:

```{r}
## generate random variables from a binomial distribution with size = 2 and prob = .5
X = rbinom(n = 1000, size = 2, prob = .5)
head(X)
## compute the fraction of the random variables that took value exactly equal to 1
x = 2
mean(X == x)
## compute the pmf for the distribution at x = 1
dbinom(x = x, size = 2, prob = .5)
```

Apologies for the notation, but the norm is to denote random variables by capital letters and to denote the actual values they take by lower-case letters.

You'll often see things like $P(X = x)$, which means the probability that a random variable $X$ takes value $x$.

------

Continuous random variables:

- Formally: A random variable whose cumulative distribution function is continuous.

- You can think of this as random variables that can take values either on the entire real line, or on subsets of the real line.

- For example: normal distribution, gamma distribution

- In contrast to discrete random variables, if $X$ is a continuous random variable, there are no values $x$ for which $P(X = x) > 0$.

- Because of this, we can't define a probability mass function the way we did for discrete random variables, we have to do something else, and that something else is a probability density function.

------

Probability density function formally: If $X$ is a continuous random variable with cumulative distribution function $F_X$, the probability density function of $X$, $f_X(x)$, is defined as $f_X(x) = F_X'(x)$.

. . .

Think of as analogous to probability mass functions

- $P(X = x) = 0$ for continuous random variables, but...

- The random variable $X$ is more likely to take on values close to $x$ if $f_X(x)$ is large than if $f_X(x)$ is small.

------

In R: probability density functions for common distributions are given by functions of the form `ddist` (the same as for probability mass functions)

Syntax: `ddist(x, param1, ..., paramn)` computes $f_X(x)$ for the a random variable $X$ following distribution `dist` with parameters `param1`, ..., `paramn`


------

. . .

For example:

```{r}
dnorm(x = 0, mean = 0, sd = 1)
dnorm(x = 1, mean = 0, sd = 1)
dnorm(x = 50, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

-----

```{r}
x_vec = seq(-3, 3, length.out = 1000)
fx = sapply(x_vec, dnorm, mean = 0, sd = 1)
plot(fx ~ x_vec, type = 'l')
```

## Summing up: probability

- Random variables are like any other variables, but the values they take are random

- If $F_X$ is the cumulative distribution function for a random variable $X$, $F_X(x)$ gives $P(X \le x)$, and characterizes the distribution.

- If $f_X$ is the probability density or probability mass function for a random variable $X$, $f_X(x)$ large means that $X$ is more likely to take values exactly equal to $x$ (for discrete random variables) or close to $x$ (for continuous random variables).

## Fitting probability models to data

Setup: We have a set of data points $x_1, \ldots, x_n$, and we want to find a probability distribution that describes the data well.



. . .

Why do we want to do this?

- We are interested in the parameters

- Data compression

- Uncertainty quantification



## How do we fit probability models?

Two main strategies:

- Maximum likelihood

- Method of moments

Many variations on these themes


## Maximum likelihood

Problem: We have a family of probability distributions, indexed by a parameter $\theta$, and we need to choose one to describe the data.

Solution, heuristically:

- Assume that our data $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ are realizations of independent random variables $X_1, \ldots, X_n$, each coming from some distribution, with a parameter (vector) $\theta$ controlling the distributions.

- Find the value of $\theta$ that makes the data most likely.

- Use either the probability density (continuous random variables) or probability mass (discrete random variables) to describe how likely the data is for a given value of the parameter $\theta$.


-----

Formally:

- Let $f(x; \theta)$ be the probability density function or probability mass function of a random variable with drawn from a distribution with parameter $\theta$.

- With independent data points $x_1, x_2,\ldots , x_n$, the likelihood is

$$
L(\theta)=\prod_{i=1}^n f(x_i;\theta)
$$

. . .

Recall that the probability density/mass function describes how likely a random variable is to take a given value.

- If $f(x_i; \theta)$ is high, it is very likely that we would see the value $x_i$ if $x_i$ really came from a distribution with parameter $\theta$

- If $f(x_i; \theta)$ is low, it is unlikely that we would see the value $x_i$ if $x_i$ really came from a distribution with parameter $\theta$

Therefore: find the value of $\theta$ that maximizes the likelihood.

-----

In practice, we work with the log likelihood instead of the likelihood:

$$
\ell(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^n \log f(x_i; \theta)
$$

- Easier to work with analytically

- Better computationally because multiplying lots of small numbers together is bad (if you have a lot of data points you can get within machine tolerance of 0).

------

For example: we have data points $x_1, \ldots, x_n$, and we want to find the $N(\theta, 1)$ distribution that fits the data the best.

. . .

The likelihood is
$$
L(x;  \theta) = \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp(-\frac{1}{2}(x_i - \theta)^2)
$$

and the log likelihood is
$$
\ell(x;  \theta) = \sum_{i=1}^n\log \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp(-\frac{1}{2}(x_i - \theta)^2) \right) 
$$

------

We can use `dnorm` in R to compute the log likelihood for any $x$ and $\theta$ we want:

```{r}
## create a function that computes the log likelihood
likelihood = function(theta, x) {
    sum(log(dnorm(x, mean = theta, sd = 1)))
}
x = c(5.5, 4, 3.2, 4.7, 4.3, 3.5)
theta_vec = seq(0, 10, length.out = 100)
l_of_theta = sapply(theta_vec, likelihood, x)
plot(l_of_theta ~ theta_vec, type = 'l')
```

------

What is the maximum?
```{r}
plot(l_of_theta ~ theta_vec, type = 'l')
abline(v = mean(x))
```

------

Alternately, just search over the grid:

```{r}
max_idx = which.max(l_of_theta)
theta_vec[max_idx]
## compare with
mean(x)
```

------

Another example: Binomial, five trials, unknown success probability.

```{r}
likelihood = function(theta, x) {
    sum(log(dbinom(x = x, size = 5, prob = theta)))
}
```

-----

Compute the likelihoods for many possible values of `prob`

```{r}
x = rbinom(n = 100, size = 5, prob = .2)
theta_vec = seq(0, 1, length.out = 100)
log_likelihoods = sapply(theta_vec, likelihood, x)
plot(log_likelihoods ~ theta_vec, type = 'l')
abline(v = .2)
```

-----

We see that the maximum is pretty close to the true value, $.2$

```{r}
max_idx = which.max(log_likelihoods)
theta_vec[max_idx]
```

-----

In the binomial and normal examples, we used _grid search_.

Two reasons why those examples are silly:

- We have closed-form solutions to the problems, so we don't need to search.

- Even if we didn't have closed-form solutions, there are more efficient ways of finding the maximum than grid search.

. . .

One reason why getting the numbers is non-trivial:

- Maximum likelihood in each case is $\sum_{i=1}^n x_i / n$.

- How does the computer get the actual numbers out? Division is easy to write down but actually [non-trivial](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee486/doc/chap5.pdf).


## Distribution fitting in R

For the simple case where all the data come from the same distribution, can use `fitdistr`

Syntax: `fitdistr(x, densfun, start)` with

- `x`: A vector of length at least 1 containing the data

- `densfun`: A function whose first argument is the value at which we want the density evaluated and whose subsequent arguments are the parameters of the distribution.

- `start`: Starting values to use when searching for parameters.

## Example: negative binomial

Negative binomial distribution:

- Suppose we have a coin that we flip repeatedly, with $P(heads) = p$.

- We flip the coin until we have seen $r$ tails.

- If we let $X$ be a random variable describing the number of heads we saw, $X \sim NB(r, p)$.



. . .

Probability mass function of $X$:
$$
\begin{align*}
P(X = x) &= \begin{pmatrix}x+r-1 \\x  \end{pmatrix}(1-p)^r p^x \\
&= \frac{(x+r-1)!}{(r-1)!x!}(1-p)^r p^x
\end{align*}
$$

-----

Suppose we have $x_1,\ldots, x_n$, and we want to fit a negative binomial distribution, i.e., find the values of $r$ and $p$ that make $x_1,\ldots, x_n$ the most likely.

The log likelihood of $x_1,\ldots, x_n$ is
$$
\sum_{i=1}^n \log((x_i + r - 1)!) - \log((r-1)!) - \log(x_i!) + r \log(1-p) + x \log p
$$

If you go through the calculus, you can find a closed-form solution for the maximizing value of $p$: $\hat p = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{n r + \sum_{i=1}^n x_i}$.

There is no closed-form solution for $r$.

-----

Note: there are multiple parameterizations of the negative binomial, and R uses a slightly different one than what we defined above.

```{r, warning = FALSE}
library(MASS)
x = rnbinom(n = 1000, size = 4, mu = 5)
nb_fit = fitdistr(x, densfun = dnbinom, start = list(size = 1, mu = 1))
nb_fit
```

----

We can check informally that these values of `mu` and `size` are maximizers:

```{r}
fitted_log_lik = dnbinom(x, size = nb_fit$estimate["size"], mu = nb_fit$estimate["mu"], log = TRUE)
sum(fitted_log_lik)
## the log likelihood at a couple other values of mu and size
sum(dnbinom(x, size = 2, mu = 3, log = TRUE))
sum(dnbinom(x, size = 10, mu = 4, log = TRUE))
```

## More generally

The examples so far have all been for the simple case where we assume that all the data come from the same distribution, but:

In general, we can let different data points come from different distributions, but the setup is the same:

- We have a parameter vector $\theta$.

- Different values of $\theta$ correspond to different distributions for the data.

- We want to find $\theta$ that maximizes the likelihood of the data.

## Concretely: Linear models

We have data $y_i, \ldots, y_n$ and $x_1,\ldots, x_n$.

We assume that the $y_i$'s are realizations of random variables:
$$
\begin{align*}
y_i \sim N(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i, \sigma^2)
\end{align*}
$$

. . .

In this case:

- The $y_i$'s don't come from the same distribution (they are assumed to have different means).

- $\theta = (\beta_0, \beta_1, \sigma)$ is our parameter vector, and we want to find the value of $\theta$ that makes the data the most likely.


## Summing up

- Fitting probability distributions just means finding the one that "looks" the most like your data, according to some measure.

- For all but very simple cases where we can get closed-form solutions with pen and paper, we need more computational tools to fit these distributions.

- Over the next couple of weeks we will be looking at algorithms for this problem in more detail.
