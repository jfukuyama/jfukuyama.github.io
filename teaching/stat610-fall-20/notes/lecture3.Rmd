## Regular expressions

Reading: Matloff Chapter 11.2.

I've linked to a couple of regular expression testers from the page with the course notes.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) actually has a good treatment if you go through it slowly.

You can also find formal treatments of regular expressions in books on
the foundations of computing, e.g. Hopcroft, Motwani, and Ullman (2000). _Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation_.


## What is a regular expression?

A way of specifying a set of strings.

- For example, the regular expression

`, *`

specifies the set of strings that start with a comma and are followed by any number (including zero) of spaces.

-----

Why do we need them?

- Parsimony: We can express sets of strings more compactly.
<br><br>
For example: `(J.|Julia) Fukuyama` represents the set containing
`J. Fukuyama` and `Julia Fukuyama`

- Allows us to specify infinite-size sets in finite space.
<br><br>
For example: our `, *` expression from before.

## Regular expressions abstractly

The formal definition of a regular expression is inductive. Suppose that we have a finite alphabet $\Sigma$.

We start with specifying the following as regular expressions:

- $\emptyset$ is a regular expression specifying the empty set

- $\varepsilon$ is a regular expression specifying the set containing the empty string `""`

- Literal character $a$ is a regular expression specifying the one-element set $\{a\}$, for $a \in \Sigma$

----

The following operations, performed on regular expressions, yield
regular expressions:

- Concatenation: If $R$ and $S$ are regular expressions, $RS$ is a regular expression specifying the set of strings that can be formed by concatenating a string in $R$ followed by a string in $S$.
<br><br>
If $R = \{good, bad\}$ and $S = \{boy, girl\}$, then $RS =
\{goodboy, goodgirl, badboy, badgirl\}$.

. . .

- Alternation (boolean or): If $R$ and $S$ are regular expressions, $R|S$ is a regular expression specifying the set of strings strings formed by taking either an element of $R$ or an element of $S$. This is the same as the set union.
<br><br>
Same example: If $R = \{good, bad\}$ and $S = \{boy, girl\}$, then $R|S =
\{good, bad, boy, girl\}$.

. . .

- Kleene star: If $R$ is a regular expression, $R^\star$ is a regular expression denoting the set of strings created by concatenating any finite number (including zero) of the strings in $R$.
<br><br>
If $R = \{good, bad\}$, $R^\star$ contains , good, goodgood,
goodbad, bad, badgood, badbadgood, and so on


. . .

Order of operations: Kleene star has highest priority, followed by
concatenation, followed by alternation.

If a different grouping is desired, use parentheses `()`.



-----

Examples:

- `a|b`: `{"a", "b"}`

- `a|b*`: `{ε, "a", "b", "bb", "bbb", ...}`

. . .

- `(a|b)*`: The set of all string containing only `a` and `b`, `{ε, "a", "b", "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb", "aaa", ...}` 

. . .

- `ab*(c|ε)`: The set of strings starting with a single `a`,
followed by zero or more `b`'s, optionally ending with a `c`, `{"a", "ac", "ab", "abc", "abb", "abbc", ...}`



## How they are actually implemented

Actual implementations of regular expressions have many more symbols and operators, but they are mostly just shorthand for some common operations that would take longer to express using only the three operations in the formal definition.



## Quantification operations

- `*`: Same as in the formal definition: zero or more times.

- `?`: Zero or one occurrence of the preceding element. `colou?r`
matches `color` and `colour`.

- `+`: One or more occurrences of the preceding element.

- `{m}`: Exactly m occurrences of the preceding element.

- `{m,}`: At least m occurrences of the preceding element.

- `{m,n}`: Between m and n occurrences of the preceding element, inclusive.

## Alternatives to |

- `[]`: Matches any single character inside the brackets.

- `[^ ]`: Negation, matches anything _except_ the set of characters
inside the brackets.

- `.`: Wildcard, matches any character.

- Character classes, defined differently for the different
implementations. See
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#Character_classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#Character_classes),
the POSIX column.

## What do we do with regular expressions?

- Check whether a string contains a regular expression

- Extract the portion of the string that matches a regular expression

- Split a string into pieces delimited by a regular expression


## Finding regular expressions

`grep`

- syntax: `grep(regex, string)`.

- `regex` is a regular expression

- `string` is a character vector

- The function will return the indices in string that match `regex`

. . .

`grepl` (for grep logical): Same as `grep`, but returns a Boolean vector describing the
match indices.

. . .

Pedantic note:

- A regular expression describes a set of strings.

- If I say a string `s` "contains" or "matches" a regular expression `re`, I mean that a substring of `s` is present in the set described by `re`.

-----

. . .

```{r}
grep("(K|k)ansas", state.name)
grepl("(K|k)ansas", state.name)
```


-----

`grep` and `grepl` just tell us if the regular expression is
present. What if you want to know where it is within the string?

. . .

`regexpr`

- Syntax: `regexpr(regex, string)`

- `regex` is a regular expression.

- `string` is a character vector.

- Gives the location of the first occurrence of the `regex`
expression in `string`.

. . .

`gregexpr`: Same syntax as `regexpr`, but gives the locations of _all_
the occurrences of `regex` instead of just the first.



-----

Example:

. . .

```{r}
fruits = "apple|banana|fruit"
regexpr(fruits, "fruit flies like a banana")
```

```{r}
gregexpr(fruits, "fruit flies like a banana")
```

-----


If you want the text that matches the regular expression, you need `regmatches`

Syntax: `regmatches(text, match)`

- `match` is the output from `regexpr` or `gregexpr`, describing the
locations of the regular expressions.

- `text` is the character vector you passed to `regexpr` or
`gregexpr`.

. . .

The pattern you use to extract the text is

`regmatches(text, regexpr(re, text))`


-----

Example: We have some sentence fragments and we would like to extract all the fruits from the text.

```{r}
fruit_fly_text = "drosophila like bananas"
wasp_text = "wasps like bananas and baby fruit flies"
fruits
```

. . .

```{r}
regmatches(fruit_fly_text, regexpr(fruits, fruit_fly_text))
regmatches(wasp_text, regexpr(fruits, wasp_text))
regmatches(fruit_fly_text, gregexpr(fruits, fruit_fly_text))
regmatches(wasp_text, gregexpr(fruits, wasp_text))
```


## Splitting on regular expressions

Syntax: `strsplit(s, split)`

- `s` is a character vector (can have length greater than 1), and the
function vectorizes.

- `split` gives the regular expression we want to split on: every element of `s`
will be split into pieces separated by the regex `split`.

. . .

Two other arguments you should know about, `fixed` and `perl`:

- `fixed = TRUE` means to
treat `split` as the literal string instead of a regular expression, `fixed =
FALSE` is the default and means that we treat the splitting expression
as a regular expression.

- `perl` relates to the flavor of regular expressions used.


-----

. . .

[1](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/myl/languagelog/archives/002932.html) [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma)

```{r}
strsplit("my parents, Ayn Rand, and God", ",[[:space:]]*(and)?[[:space:]]+")
strsplit("my parents, Ayn Rand and God", ",[[:space:]]*(and)?[[:space:]]+")
strsplit("my parents, Ayn Rand and God", "(,[[:space:]]*)|([[:space:]]+and[[:space:]]+)")
```

## Two more ideas

- Greedy quantification: There can be more than one match of a string to a regular expression that begins at the same place. Which one do you want?

- Anchoring: Can constrain the expression to match at certain places in words or lines.

## Greedy quantification

By default, quantifiers are greedy, meaning they match the longest
substring possible.

We can make them have the opposite behavior by modifying them with the
`?` character: in that case, they match the shortest substring
possible.

```{r}
regmatches("[i][j]", regexpr("\\[.*\\]", "[i][j]"))
regmatches("[i][j]", regexpr("\\[.*?\\]", "[i][j]"))
```

. . .

Note: Escaping

- The special characters used for regular expressions need to be escaped using `\\`.

- One `\` is the normal escape character, its function is to tell the string processing tools that the next character should be read in a special way.

- When we create a regular expression, we need a literal `\`, and so we need to escape the escape character.


## Anchoring

- `^` (not inside square brackets) means that what comes after must be
at the start of a line.

- `$` means that what comes before must be at the end of a line.

- `\<` anchors to the beginning of a word.

- `\>` anchors to the end of a word. Note that when you create a
string using this operator, you will have to escape the `\`

- `\b` anchors to the boundary of words (beginning or ending)

- `\B` anchors to anywhere aside from the boundary

```{r}
grepl("\\<a", "hat at")
grepl("\\<a", "hat cat")
grepl("\\bnana", "bananas")
grepl("\\Bnana", "bananas")
```
