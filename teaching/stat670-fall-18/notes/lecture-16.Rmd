Today: PCA

- Intuition

- Examples

## A contrived example

Suppose we have a 3-dimensional object that we want to investigate.

Due to some strange set of constraints, we are only allowed to see its shadow.

Without knowing anything about the object, what sort of a shadow would you expect to be most useful?

It seems like the most useful shadow is the biggest one: If we were only allowed one view, we would ask for the one that took up the most space.

It's easy to come up with examples where this isn't the most useful, but it's a good place to start if you don't know anything about the data.

The same will be true of PCA.

## PCA as variance maximization

In PCA, we have a data matrix $\mathbf X \in \mathbb R^{n \times p}$ with centered columns.

We think of the rows of $\mathbf X$ as points in $p$-dimensional space, and we want to project the points down into a lower-dimensional space so we can visualize them.

There are a lot of different ways we could do this, but in PCA we want to find the projection that maximizes the variance of the projected points.

## The PCA optimization problem

First consider projecting the points onto a line.

The PCA problem is to find
$$
\mathbf w_{(1)} = \text{arg max}_{\mathbf w : \|\mathbf w \| = 1} \sum_{i=1}^n (\mathbf x_i \cdot \mathbf w)^2
$$
where $\mathbf x_i$ is the $i$th row of $\mathbf X$.

$\mathbf w_{(1)}$ is then the first principal component.

-----

If we want projections into higher-dimensional spaces, we take more principal components.

We find the $k$th principal component as
$$
\mathbf w_{(k)} = \text{arg max}_{\mathbf w :\| \mathbf w \| = 1, \mathbf w^T \mathbf w_{(j)} = 0, j = 1, \ldots, k-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (\mathbf x_i \cdot \mathbf w)^2
$$

The constraint that $\mathbf w^T \mathbf w_{(k)} = 0, j = 1,\ldots, k-1$ means that the $k$th principal component is orthogonal to all the previous principal components, and is needed to ensure a unique solution to the problem.

## Solution to the PCA problem

The solution to the PCA is given by the SVD.

If $\mathbf X$ has centered columns and $\mathbf X = \mathbf U \mathbf D \mathbf V^T$ is the SVD of g, then

- The $k$th principal component is the $k$th column of $\mathbf V$.

- The projections of the points onto the $k$th principal component are given by the $k$th column of $\mathbf U \mathbf D$.

```{r}

```


## PCA Biplots

Two types of biplots, _form_ and _covariance_. Let's start off with the _form_ biplot.

- For each sample we plot a point with the sample scores along the principal axes.

- For each variable, we make an arrow with the variable weights along the principal axes.

This allows us to read off the sample scores along the principal axes and the variable weights along the principal axes.

. . .

However, there's another way to interpret the PCA biplot:

- Since the PCA solution is given by the SVD, the biplot is the same as the reduced-rank biplot (up to choices of how to scale the biplot points and biplot axes).

- In particular, the form biplot is a reduced-rank biplot where we use $\mathbf U_{(2)} \mathbf D_{(2)}$ to plot the biplot points, and $\mathbf V_{(2)}$ to plot the biplot axes.

- Therefore, we can read the PCA biplot as giving us an approximation to the centered data matrix $\mathbf X$


## PCA biplot for the olympic data

```{r}
## scale = 0 means form biplot
ggbiplot(oly_noscale, scale = 0)
```


## Covariance biplot

The _covariance_ biplot is very subtly different from the form biplot, the difference being how the singular values are allocated.

In the covariance biplot, we use

- $\mathbf U_{(2)}$ for the biplot points

- $\mathbf V_{(2)} \mathbf D_{(2)}$ for the biplot axes.

In this form of the biplot, angles between biplot axes give us approximations of the covariances.

Why is this?

------

Following up on what we talked about regarding correlations between variables, note the following two relationships:

- If $\mathbf X$ has centered columns, then $\mathbf X \mathbf X^T$ is the sample covariance matrix.

- If $\mathbf X = \mathbf U \mathbf D \mathbf V^T$, then $\mathbf X \mathbf X^T = \mathbf V \mathbf D^2 \mathbf V^T$.

Therefore, the columns of $\mathbf V \mathbf D$ can be seen as giving us both biplot points and biplot axes for approximating the _covariance_ matrix, and projections of one biplot axis onto another biplot axis tells us about the covariance between the two variables.

## Covariance biplot

```{r}
## scale = 1 means covariance biplot
ggbiplot(oly_noscale, scale = 1)
```



## Correlation-based PCA

The example above suggests that doing PCA when the variables are on different scales isn't always that useful.

When the variables are on different scales and measure different things, we often standardize the columns of $\mathbf X$ (divide each column by its standard deviation) before performing PCA.

This is sometimes referred to as correlation-based PCA, as opposed to covariance-based PCA.

## Correlation-based PCA biplot

Analogous to the covariance-based PCA biplot:

- Sample points represent the scores on the principal axes.

- Variable points represent variable weights on the principal axes.

Interpretation as a reduced-rank biplot:

- Correlation-based PCA biplot is just a reduced-rank biplot approximating a centered and scaled data matrix.

- We still have biplot points and axes, and they describe the elements of the centered and scaled data matrix.

Relationships between the variables:

- Projections of biplot axes onto each other now describe correlations between variables instead of covariances.

Covariance PCA biplot based on correlations, with some extra information:

```{r}
oly_scale = prcomp(olympic$tab, scale. = TRUE)
## scale = 1 means covariance biplot
ggbiplot(oly_scale, scale = 1)
```

How would you interpret the first principal component?

------

Covariance PCA biplot based on correlations, with some extra information:

```{r}
## scale = 1 means covariance biplot
ggbiplot(oly_scale, scale = 1) +
    geom_point(aes(color = olympic$score)) +
    scale_color_viridis("Score")
```
