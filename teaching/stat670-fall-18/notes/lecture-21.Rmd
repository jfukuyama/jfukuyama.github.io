## Problem setup

We are interested in understanding voting patterns, and in particular
how vote for president is related to income.

There is data on this topic in the
[ANES dataset](http://jfukuyama.github.io/teaching/stat670/notes/anes.csv): for each election, 
they have demographic information on a subset of voters plus
information about how they voted in the presidential elections.

The variables here have particularly uninformative names, but the ones
we are interested in describe the year, income, and presidential
vote. They are coded as:

- Year: VCF0004

- Income: VCF0114

- Vote: VCF0704a

The primary difference between our task here and the modeling that
we've done earlier in the semester is that the variable we're trying
to predict, vote, is binary. That is, it only takes two values (here
vote for Republicans vs. vote for Democrats) instead
of taking as a value any real number. This turns out to be enough of a
difference that we need a new modeling technique.

-----

Income is measured on a scale from 1 to 5:

1: 0 to 16 percentile

2: 17 to 33 percentile

3: 34 to 67 percentile

4: 68 to 95 percentile

5: 96 to 100 percentile

The zeroes and NA’s are missing values (this is terrible).
Using percentiles allows comparability between years. Also note that
this is really an ordinal variable but we might find some advantages
in treating it as quantitative.

```{r}
ANES = read.csv("../../datasets/anes.csv")
income = ANES$VCF0114
summary(income)
table(income) / length(income)
```

-----

Next we need the year for each observation. This is VCF0004.

```{r}
year = ANES$VCF0004
summary(year)
```

-----

The coding is that “1” means the Democrat, “2” means the Republican,
and “0” or “NA” means some other outcome. We want everything to be
coded as 0, 1, or NA (using 0/1 coding is the standard way to code
binary variables for logistic regression).

```{r}
vote = ANES$VCF0704a
##  First, change the zeroes to NA’s:
vote[vote == 0] = NA
## Then, to go from 2 representing Republican and 1 representing Democrat to 1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat, we just have to subtract 1
vote = vote - 1
summary(vote)
```

The variable really represents a two-party vote for a Republican now,
so for clarity let’s just rename it as such.
```{r}
Republican = vote
```

-----

Let's put everything in a data frame, and then filter to just
presidential election years:
```{r}
ANES_df = data.frame(year, income, Republican)
ANES_df = filter(ANES_df, year %in% seq(1948, 2012, 4))
summary(ANES_df)
```

## Visualizing the relationship with one predictor

The first question we can ask is about the relationship between income and the probability
of voting Republican in 1992. Let's start off just by plotting the two
points. It turns out that this isn't trivial because the variables are
categorical, and we need to do some work to get anything
useful. Jittering helps with categorical variables, and we use it here:

```{r}
ANES92 = subset(ANES_df, year == 1992)
ggplot(ANES92, aes(x = income, y = Republican)) +
    geom_point()
ggplot(ANES92, aes(x = income, y = Republican)) +
    geom_jitter(height = 0.1, width = 0.25)
```

The jittered plot is ok, but here it's actually more useful to compute
the fraction of the vote going to Republicans and either look at the
table or plot those values.
```{r}
ANES92 %>%
    group_by(income) %>%
    summarise(mean(Republican, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## How could we model this relationship?

This gives the proportion (out of major party voters) who voted for
Bush for each income group. Aside from group zero, which represents
missing values of income, we see a strictly increasing pattern. How do
we model this? Three options (not the only three) include:

1. Linear regression with income as a numerical predictor.

2. Logistic regression with income as a numerical predictor.

3. Regression with income as a categorical (factor) predictor. (In
this linear and logistic give identical predictions.)

-----

Method 1 is the easiest to interpret: we get a slope that directly
tells us the change in model probability of voting Republican as
income goes up one category. However, linear regression for binary
responses has two big limitations:

- The technical limitation is that it only works well when probabilities are far from 0
and 1. Otherwise, if $x$ is unbounded, you can end up with negative
probabilities or probabilities greater than 1.

- There is also a social limitation in that statisticians will be
quite upset with you and your work if you use linear regression to
model binary data.

Method 3 isn’t really a model at all: it just returns the proportion
within each category who voted for Bush, the same as our `summarise()`
call gave us above. There’s something to be said for not fitting
restrictive models when you don’t have to. However, if our goal is to
fit more complex models or make comparisons between different sets of
data, as it eventually will be, then some degree of simplification may
be useful to understand the patterns in the data. Or we might fit a
simplifying model first, then go back and look at the data in more
detail and see if there are any important features our model
missed. That will be our basic approach here.

Method 2, logistic regression, should work well. It does require
treating a predictor that isn’t inherently a numeric variable as
numeric, and requires a parametric form (effects are linear on a logit
scale.) However, most of the time, doing this is reasonable as long as
the pattern of the probability with $x$ is monotonic and as long as
predictive accuracy is not the sole goal.

## Logistic regression with one predictor


We fit such a logistic regression using income as a quantitative
variable and omitting missing values. Logistic regression is a special
case of a GLM, so we use the `glm()` function; specifying a binomial
family fits a logistic regression by default. Firstly, we can just add
the fitted curve to the jittered plot: 

```{r}
ANES92 = subset(ANES92, income > 0)
ggplot(ANES92, aes(x = income, y = Republican)) +
    geom_jitter(height = 0.1, width = 0.25) +
    geom_smooth(method = "glm", method.args = list(family = "binomial"))
```

We can also fit it explicitly:

```{r}
logit_92 = glm(Republican ~ income, family = binomial, data = ANES92)
summary(logit_92)
```

The summary gives a lot of information; we’ll focus on the
coefficients. The summary tells us that 

$$
\text{logit}[P(\text{Republican})]=−1.27+0.298\times \text{income}
$$

where the logit function is

$$
\text{logit}(x)=\text{log}_e [x/(1−x)]
$$

To find $P(\text{Republican})$, we invert the logit:

$$
P(\text{Republican})=\frac{e^y}{1+e^y}
$$

where
$$
y=\text{logit}[P(\text{Republican})].
$$

For a quick and dirty interpretation, the "divide by 4" rule is
useful: the maximum change in probability associated with a one unit
change in $x$ is the coefficient of $x$ divided by four. So going one
income group changes the model probability by up to about 7.5%. This
looks like it’s about the increase in the curve from income group 4 to
group 5. 

We can check how good the approximation is:
```{r}
## the package boot has the inv.logit function
library(boot)
## P(Republican) evaluated at income = 4
inv.logit(-1.27 + 0.298 * 4)
## P(Republican) evaluated at income = 5
inv.logit(-1.27 + 0.298 * 5)
```

## Fitting a series of regressions

We’re not just interested in 1992. We want to know the relationship
between income and vote for every Presidential election we have data
for – is the relationship similar for every election, or are some
elections different? Has there been a consistent change over time? 

In programming terms, the easiest way to fit the same model on many
subsets of the data is to write a function that subsets the data and
fits the model, then to write a for loop to fit the model for each
subset. There are much more computationally efficient approaches, but
otherwise more efficiency usually isn’t worth the effort. 

Here’s a function to fit our weighted logistic regression of vote on
income for any given year. 

```{r}
logit_ANES_subset = function(my_year, data) {
    newdata = subset(data, year == my_year)
    newdata = subset(newdata, income > 0)
    model = glm(Republican ~ income, family = binomial, 
        data = newdata)
    output = c(my_year, summary(model)$coef[2, 1:2])
    return(output)
}
```


The function returns the year, the model’s coefficient for income, and
the standard error of that coefficient. We shouldn’t take the standard
error too literally, because we haven’t accounted for the complex
design of the ANES surveys.

Let’s test the function out on 1992 (Bush-Clinton).

```{r}
logit_ANES_subset(my_year = 1992, data = ANES_df)
```

-----

Once we've checked that it works, we can loop over every presidential
election year in our dataset: every four years between 1948 and 2012:
```{r}
years = seq(1948, 2012, 4)
n = length(years)
income_by_year = data.frame(year = rep(NA, n), income_coef = rep(NA, n), income_se = rep(NA, n))
for (J in 1:n) {
    my_year = years[J]
    income_by_year[J, ] = logit_ANES_subset(my_year = my_year, data = ANES_df)
}
```

-----

We’ll display the results using `ggplot`. `geom_errorbar()` lets
us add one standard error bounds. We shouldn’t take these too
literally, just use them to get a ballpark idea of uncertainty. 

```{r}
gg = ggplot(income_by_year, aes(x = year, y = income_coef, ymin = income_coef - 
    income_se, ymax = income_coef + income_se))
gg + geom_errorbar(width=1) + geom_smooth(method.args = list(family = "symmetric")) + 
    ylab("Coefficient of income in linear model")
```


The income coefficient is positive for every election, meaning richer
people were more likely to vote Republican every time (though 1960 was
close.) The general trend was an increase in the income coefficient
from 1952 to 1984, then a leveling-off. There was a huge drop from
1948 to 1952; unfortunately we don’t have data from before 1948 to
know if the election was typical. Otherwise there are a couple of
elections outside the confidence band: 1964 (Johnson over Goldwater)
and 2008 (Obama over McCain.) 

## Less modeling, more detail

In our regressions, we treated income as a quantitative variable. A
simpler approach would be to treat it as a factor, and simply track
the weighted proportion of each income group that (two-party) voted
Republican by year. Again, this is easiest to program (if inefficient)
using a for loop. 

To find means, I used use `mean()` in conjunction with
`summarise()` in dplyr. Let’s first work out how to do it for the 1992
data. 
```{r}
summarise(group_by(ANES92, factor(income)), prop_Republican = mean(Republican, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r}
income_prop = ANES_df %>%
    group_by(income, year) %>%
    summarise(prop_Republican = mean(Republican, na.rm = TRUE))
## clean up a bit
income_prop = income_prop %>%
    subset(income > 0) %>%
    ## making income an ordered factor will give a nice color scale for us later
    mutate(income_ord = factor(income, levels = 1:5, ordered = TRUE))
```


```{r}
gg = ggplot(income_prop, aes(x = year, y = prop_Republican, group = income_ord, color = income_ord)) + geom_line()
gg + ylab("Proportion of two-party vote for Republican") + labs(color = "Income percentile")
```

-----

We now have a bit more detail on the trends and the aberrant results.

- The top income group is reliably the most Republican, but the bottom
income group isn’t always the most Democratic (although it was in the
middle part of the time period.)

- In 1948 there were pretty big differences between income groups, but
in the 1950s the differences between all groups except the richest
were small. It’s guess work whether 1948 was an aberration or whether
the small income differences from 1952 to 1968 were historical unusual
(though I suspect it’s the latter.)

- The big coefficient for 1964 (compared to the elections before and
after) might be in part an artifact of the logit scale.

- In 2008 there really was a big difference between income group,
which is likely attributable to the financial crisis. 

-----

We can also draw lines to connect income groups by year. Because there
are so many different years, we’ll facet them rather than color them. 


```{r, fig.height=4}
ggplot(income_prop, aes(x = income, y = prop_Republican)) +
    geom_line() +
    facet_wrap(~ year, ncol = 5) + ylab("Proportion of two-party vote for Republican")
```

This yields less insight, but still has interesting features: notably
the big magnitude of the uptick in Republicanism for the highest
income group for almost every year. (It would be interesting to check
if this continued to hold in 2016.) 

## Data summaries vs. data models

Both data summaries (like our last plot) and models (like our logistic regressions) have their uses.

- Data summaries require fewer assumptions, and often give you a
fuller picture than a model. However, they can be noisy or just too
complicated to easily get a grip on. 

- Models require assumptions, so in addition to being reductive,
there’s more potential for things to go horribly wrong. However,
models can be a easy way into the data: everything gets summarized in
a couple of parameters, and you can put your effort into understanding
what those parameters really mean. Furthermore, complexity can easily
be added to models – for example, it’s easy to build a logistic
regression model with multiple predictors (as we’ll see in the next
lecture.) 

In practice, going back and forth between models and data summaries,
as we did here, is often very useful in exploratory work. Models can
usefully simplify the data so you can get the big picture. Then you
can look a fuller data summary and bear in results that the big
picture doesn’t explain.
